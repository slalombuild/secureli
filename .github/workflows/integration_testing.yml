# This workflow pulls the published seCureLI packages from Pypi & Homebrew & executes them against a test repo
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python

# TODO we should rename these to smoke tests but I'd rather hold off on doing that for now
# since renaming the workflow/action might cause us to lose history for executions under the old name
