# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a single version of Python
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
# These jobs are specifically designed to test the codebase
# and ensure that basic contributing from both mac and windows will work
# Once both windows and mac builds are successful, the next steps will
# - using semantic-version will version the code, pushing the version back to the repo
# - push a package to pypi
# - push a formula to the homebrew repo
