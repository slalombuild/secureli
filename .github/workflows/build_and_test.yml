# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a single version of Python
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
# These jobs are specifically designed to test the codebase
# and ensure that basic contributing from both mac and windows will work
