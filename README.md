<h1 align="center">SeCureLI</h1>
<strong>The Builder's Security CLI</strong>

SeCureLI is a tool that enables you to experience the delight of building products by helping you get ideas from your head into working software as frictionlessly as possible, in a reliable, secure, scalable, and observable way.

SeCureLI:

- scans your local repo for secrets before you commit code to a remote repository
- installs linters based on the code of your project to support security and coding best practices
- configures all the hooks needed so you don’t have to

SeCureLI isn’t a magic tool that makes things secure because you have it. It enables a lot of other tools that you could set up individually and helps you as a builder write better code.

# Installation and Usage

## Secureli Installation via Homebrew

Current the only packaging tool that is supported for Secureli is Homebrew. To install secureli via homebrew, issue the following commands

```commandline
brew tap slalombuild/secureli
brew install secureli
```

## Upgrading Secureli via Homebrew

To update secureli, you can use the standard homebrew update command to pull down the latest formula

```commandline
brew update
```

# Usage

Once installed you can see the latest documentation for SeCureLI by entering the following on a command prompt:

```python
% secureli --help
```

You will see a list of commands and descriptions of each. You can also pull up documentation for each command with the same pattern. For example:

```python
(secureli-py3.9) tristan@Tristans-MacBook-Pro secureli % secureli init --help

 Usage: secureli init [OPTIONS]

 Detect languages and initialize pre-commit hooks and linters for the project

╭─ Options ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ --reset  -r        Disregard the installed configuration, if any, and treat as a new install   │
│ --yes    -y        Say 'yes' to every prompt automatically without input                       │
│ --help             Show this message and exit.                                                 │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

When invoking these commands, you can combine the short versions into a single flag. For example, the following commands are equivalent:

```python
% secureli init --reset --yes
% secureli init -ry
```

# Configuration

SeCureLI is configurable via a .secureli.yaml file present in the consuming repository.
