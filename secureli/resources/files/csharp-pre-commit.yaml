    # Note: The dotnet format pre-commit setup combines poorly to be tightly coupled with
    # a pre-release version of .net that is old and no one has installed. dotnet format has
    # since become a part of .net! So we can use dotnet format already installed on your
    # simply. This runs the risk that different folks will run different versions, but
    # this is better than nothing.
    # see https://github.com/dotnet/format/issues/1350 and the resolution PR at the bottom.
